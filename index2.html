  <h2>Security Operations Center (SOC)</h2>
  <p>
    A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized function responsible for
    continuously monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity
    threats across an organization.
    <br><br>
    SOC teams work with SIEM systems, threat intelligence, log analysis, and incident
    response tools to identify attacks such as malware, data breaches, insider threats,
    and network intrusions in real time.
    <br><br>
    <b>SOC exists to reduce detection time, contain damage, and maintain security visibility 24/7.</b>
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ENDPOINT SECURITY -->
<section id="endpoint" class="info-section" style="background: linear-gradient(to bottom right, #E3FDF5, #FFE6FA);">
  <h2>Endpoint Security</h2>
  <p>
    Endpoint Security protects devices such as laptops, desktops, servers, and mobile
    devices that connect to an organization’s network.
    <br><br>
    Since endpoints are directly used by humans, they are frequent attack targets.
    Endpoint security solutions include antivirus, EDR/XDR, device control,
    behavioral analysis, and disk encryption.
    <br><br>
    <b>The goal is to stop threats at the device level before they spread.</b>
  </p>
</section>

<!-- CLOUD SECURITY -->
<section id="cloud" class="info-section" style="background: linear-gradient(to bottom right, #FEF3C7, #FCA5A5);">
  <h2>Cloud Security</h2>
  <p>
    Cloud Security focuses on protecting applications, data, identities, and workloads
    hosted in cloud environments such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
    <br><br>
    It includes access control (IAM), encryption, secure configurations, container
    security, API protection, and compliance monitoring.
    <br><br>
    Cloud security operates under a shared responsibility model: the provider secures
    the infrastructure, while the customer secures data, identities, and configurations.
    <br><br>
    <b>Cloud Security ensures scalability without sacrificing control or trust.</b>

  <p>What Grafana actually is

Grafana is an open-source visualization and observability platform.
It does not collect data by itself. <br>It connects to data sources, queries them, and turns the results into dashboards, charts, and alerts.
<br>
<i><q>Think of Grafana as the display + alert layer, not the data producer.</q></i></p>
